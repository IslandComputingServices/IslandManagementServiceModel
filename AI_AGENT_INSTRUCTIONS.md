# AI Agent Instructions for IslandsManagementService-vishalsirohi

## üö® CRITICAL: ICS IS AN INDEPENDENT CLOUD PLATFORM

### FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING:
**ICS (Island Computing Services) is a COMPLETE, INDEPENDENT cloud computing platform. ICS operates its own data centers, servers, networking, and storage infrastructure. ICS competes directly with other major cloud providers.**

**API field names and patterns follow industry standards for developer familiarity - to reduce learning curve for customers.**

## üö® CRITICAL: REPOSITORY AND ATTRIBUTE CONSTRAINTS

### REPOSITORY CREATION RULES:
- MUST ask for explicit approval before creating ANY new repository
- MUST use IslandComputingServices organization for all ICS repositories
- MUST NOT create repositories under personal accounts
- MUST follow ICS repository naming conventions
- MUST get team approval for repository structure and purpose

### ATTRIBUTE CONSTRAINTS:
- MUST NOT assume or make up email addresses
- MUST NOT assume or make up service URLs
- MUST NOT assume or make up contact information
- MUST NOT assume or make up domain names
- MUST ask for explicit values for all contact and service information

### FILE CLEANUP RULES:
- MUST NOT commit temporary files (READY.md, PR_READY.md, etc.)
- MUST clean up all temporary files before committing
- MUST only commit relevant specification and documentation files
- MUST follow clean commit practices and standards

### BEFORE ANY REPOSITORY OPERATIONS:
- [ ] Get explicit approval for repository creation
- [ ] Confirm organization (IslandComputingServices)
- [ ] Confirm repository name and purpose
- [ ] Get actual contact information and service URLs
- [ ] Verify all assumed attributes with user
- [ ] Clean up all temporary files

### FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING:
**ICS (Island Computing Services) is a COMPLETE, INDEPENDENT cloud computing platform. ICS operates its own data centers, servers, networking, and storage infrastructure. ICS competes directly with other major cloud providers.**

**API field names and patterns follow industry standards for developer familiarity - to reduce learning curve for customers.**

### AGENT MUST NEVER:
- Assume ICS uses external cloud infrastructure or services
- Reference external cloud ARNs, services, or resources in ICS APIs
- Suggest external cloud integration or dependencies
- Imply ICS is built on top of any other platform
- Make up or modify IRN format specifications

### AGENT MUST ALWAYS:
- Treat ICS as independent cloud platform with native infrastructure
- Use EXACT IRN format from ICS Resource Identification specifications
- Design native ICS services and capabilities
- Maintain complete separation from all external platforms

## üåç ICS REGION SUPPORT

### CURRENT REGION:

### AGENT CONSTRAINTS:
- MUST use "ap-in-1" as the ONLY region in all IRNs and APIs
- MUST NOT reference any other regions
- MUST NOT assume multi-region support exists

## üìã IRN FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS (IMMUTABLE)

### EXACT IRN FORMAT (MUST NOT BE MODIFIED):
```
irn:ics:<service>:<region>:organization/<organization-id>[:scope/<scope-id>][:ext/<token>]:island/<island-id>[:resource/<resource-id> | :resource-path/<type>/<path>][:version/<n>]
```

### IRN COMPONENTS (FIXED SPECIFICATION):
- **irn:ics** - Fixed prefix for ICS resources
- **<service>** - ICS service (core, compute, storage, network, etc.)
- **<region>** - MUST be "ap-in-1" (only supported region)
- **organization/<organization-id>** - Organization context (REQUIRED)
- **scope/<scope-id>** - Optional customer-defined grouping
- **ext/<token>** - Optional platform extensibility segment
- **island/<island-id>** - Island identifier (REQUIRED for island resources)
- **resource/<resource-id>** - Optional resource under island
- **resource-path/<type>/<path>** - Optional hierarchical path
- **version/<n>** - Optional version for audit traceability

### IRN EXAMPLES (EXACT FORMAT):
```
Organization: irn:ics:core:ap-in-1:organization/org-123456
Island: irn:ics:core:ap-in-1:organization/org-123456:island/isl-abcdef123

```

## üîí CRITICAL: FOLLOW ICS STANDARDS

You MUST follow all standards in `ICSCoreStandards/` directory.

### STANDARDS COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- **RFC 2119 Compliance** - Use MUST/SHOULD/MAY correctly
- **IADA Principle** - Identifiers ‚Üí APIs ‚Üí Data Models ‚Üí Architecture
- **4-Layer Architecture** - DAL ‚Üí Business ‚Üí API ‚Üí Presentation
- **Transcribe Coding** - Specifications ‚Üí Interfaces ‚Üí Implementation
- **Industry API Compatibility** - Field names and patterns for familiarity ONLY

### ANTI-DRIFT MEASURES:
- MUST read and follow ALL specifications in ICSCoreStandards/
- MUST NOT modify or interpret standards differently
- MUST NOT create new standards without explicit approval
- MUST validate all designs against existing specifications
- MUST ask for clarification if standards are unclear

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Repository Workspace Structure

This workspace supports multiple packages/repositories organized by layer:

### Repository Organization
- **Data Access Layer**: `packages/data-access-layer/`
- **Business Layer**: `packages/business-layer/`
- **API Layer**: `packages/api-layer/`
- **Presentation Layer**: `packages/presentation-layer/`
- **Shared**: `packages/shared/`

### Repository Creation Rules
- MUST ask for approval before creating new repositories
- MUST follow naming convention: `{component}-{layer}`
- MUST place repositories in appropriate layer directories
- MUST document inter-repository dependencies

## üìã Development Process

### Phase 1: System-Wide Specification Creation
1. **MUST** create system-wide specifications in `specifications/`:

   - Cross-Component Integration Specification
   - Shared Data Model Specifications
   - API Contract Specifications

2. **MUST** get approval for each specification before proceeding

### Phase 2: Repository-Specific Specifications
For each repository in `packages/`:
1. **MUST** create repository-specific specifications:
   - Component API Model Specification
   - Component Architecture Specification
   - Component Design Specification
   - Component Data Model Specification

2. **MUST** ensure specifications align with system-wide specifications

### Phase 3: Interface Generation
1. **MUST** generate shared interfaces in `packages/shared/`:
   - Cross-layer communication interfaces
   - Common type definitions
   - Shared contract specifications

2. **MUST** finalize all contracts before implementation

### Phase 4: Layer Implementation
1. **MUST** implement repositories in layer order:
   - Data Access Layer repositories
   - Business Logic Layer repositories
   - API Layer repositories
   - Presentation Layer repositories

2. **MUST** maintain layer boundaries between repositories
