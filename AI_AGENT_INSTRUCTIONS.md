# AI Agent Instructions for IslandsManagementService-vishalsirohi

## üö® CRITICAL: ICS IS AN INDEPENDENT CLOUD PLATFORM

### FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING:
**ICS (Island Computing Services) is a COMPLETE, INDEPENDENT cloud computing platform. ICS operates its own data centers, servers, networking, and storage infrastructure. ICS competes directly with other major cloud providers.**

**API field names and patterns follow industry standards for developer familiarity - to reduce learning curve for customers.**

### AGENT MUST NEVER:
- Assume ICS uses external cloud infrastructure or services
- Reference external cloud ARNs, services, or resources in ICS APIs
- Suggest external cloud integration or dependencies
- Imply ICS is built on top of any other platform
- Make up or modify IRN format specifications

### AGENT MUST ALWAYS:
- Treat ICS as independent cloud platform with native infrastructure
- Use EXACT IRN format from ICS Resource Identification specifications
- Design native ICS services and capabilities
- Maintain complete separation from all external platforms

## üåç ICS REGION SUPPORT

### CURRENT REGION:
- **ap-in-1** - Asia Pacific (India) Region 1 - ONLY supported region
- Future expansion planned but NOT implemented yet

### AGENT CONSTRAINTS:
- MUST use "ap-in-1" as the ONLY region in all IRNs and APIs
- MUST NOT reference any other regions
- MUST NOT assume multi-region support exists

## üìã IRN FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS (IMMUTABLE)

### EXACT IRN FORMAT (MUST NOT BE MODIFIED):
```
irn:ics:<service>:<region>:organization/<organization-id>[:scope/<scope-id>][:ext/<token>]:island/<island-id>[:resource/<resource-id> | :resource-path/<type>/<path>][:version/<n>]
```

### IRN COMPONENTS (FIXED SPECIFICATION):
- **irn:ics** - Fixed prefix for ICS resources
- **<service>** - ICS service (core, compute, storage, network, etc.)
- **<region>** - MUST be "ap-in-1" (only supported region)
- **organization/<organization-id>** - Organization context (REQUIRED)
- **scope/<scope-id>** - Optional customer-defined grouping
- **ext/<token>** - Optional platform extensibility segment
- **island/<island-id>** - Island identifier (REQUIRED for island resources)
- **resource/<resource-id>** - Optional resource under island
- **resource-path/<type>/<path>** - Optional hierarchical path
- **version/<n>** - Optional version for audit traceability

### IRN EXAMPLES (EXACT FORMAT):
```
Organization: irn:ics:core:ap-in-1:organization/org-123456
Island: irn:ics:core:ap-in-1:organization/org-123456:island/isl-abcdef123
Island with scope: irn:ics:core:ap-in-1:organization/org-123456:scope/prod:island/isl-abcdef123

- **`specifications/`** - MUST contain change specifications, enhancement proposals, requirements documents
- **`src/`** - MUST contain implementation code (if present)
- **`docs/`** - MUST contain documentation (if present)

### AGENT DIRECTORY RULES:
- MUST place Smithy IDL models in `model/` directory
- MUST place change specifications and feature requests in `specifications/` directory
- MUST NOT mix models with specifications
- MUST maintain clear separation between current models and future specifications

## üß† AGENT CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
Agent MUST read and understand ALL existing content before making ANY assumptions:

#### **1. EXISTING MODELS AND SPECIFICATIONS:**
- MUST read all files in `model/` directory to understand current service definitions
- MUST read all files in `specifications/` directory to understand planned changes
- MUST read all files in `src/` directory to understand implementation patterns
- MUST analyze existing Smithy models to understand namespace hierarchy
- MUST understand existing IRN patterns and resource naming conventions

#### **2. NAMESPACE AND PACKAGE ANALYSIS:**
- MUST extract namespace patterns from existing Smithy models (e.g., `com.islandcomputing.ims`)
- MUST understand service abbreviations from existing code (e.g., `ims` for Island Management Service)
- MUST analyze package structure from existing implementations
- MUST identify naming conventions from existing resources
- MUST NEVER assume namespace values without referencing existing patterns

#### **3. IRN FORMAT UNDERSTANDING:**
- MUST read ICS IRN format specifications from ICSCoreStandards
- MUST analyze existing IRN patterns in models to understand service namespaces
- MUST understand IRN hierarchy: `irn:ics:<service>:<region>:organization/<org-id>:island/<island-id>`
- MUST identify correct service namespace from existing models (e.g., `ims` not `core`)
- MUST NEVER assume IRN format components without verification

#### **4. URL AND ENDPOINT ANALYSIS:**
- MUST extract endpoint patterns from existing service definitions
- MUST understand URL structure from existing API specifications
- MUST identify region patterns (e.g., `ap-in-1`) from existing configurations
- MUST analyze domain patterns from existing endpoints
- MUST NEVER assume URL structure without referencing existing patterns

#### **5. CONFIGURATION ATTRIBUTES:**
Agent MUST NEVER assume values for:
- **Service Names** - Extract from existing models and specifications
- **SDK Names** - Reference existing service definitions
- **Package Names** - Analyze existing code structure
- **Email Addresses** - Always ask user or reference existing configurations
- **Domain Names** - Extract from existing endpoint configurations
- **Region Codes** - Reference existing IRN patterns and service definitions
- **Organization IDs** - Use patterns from existing examples
- **Resource Names** - Follow existing naming conventions

### VERIFICATION AND CONFIRMATION PROCESS:

#### **BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:**
1. **READ EXISTING CONTEXT** - Analyze all relevant files in repository
2. **EXTRACT PATTERNS** - Identify existing naming, namespace, and structure patterns
3. **VERIFY ASSUMPTIONS** - Cross-reference with ICS standards and existing implementations
4. **CONFIRM WITH USER** - When patterns are unclear or missing, ask for clarification
5. **DOCUMENT DECISIONS** - Explain reasoning based on existing patterns

#### **WHEN PATTERNS ARE UNCLEAR:**
- MUST ask user for clarification rather than assuming
- MUST provide options based on existing patterns when asking
- MUST explain what existing patterns were found and what is missing
- MUST confirm understanding before proceeding

#### **EXAMPLE VERIFICATION PROCESS:**
```
Agent Analysis:
1. Found namespace "com.islandcomputing.ims" in existing model
2. Found service abbreviation "ims" in @irnNamespace trait
3. Found region "ap-in-1" in existing IRN patterns
4. Missing: email configuration for service contact
5. Action: Ask user for email pattern or reference existing configuration
```

### CONTEXT INFERENCE RULES:

#### **SAFE TO INFER FROM EXISTING PATTERNS:**
- Namespace structure if consistent pattern exists
- Service abbreviations if defined in existing models
- IRN format components if examples exist
- URL patterns if endpoint definitions exist
- Resource naming if conventions are established

#### **MUST ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- Email addresses and contact information
- New service names not in existing patterns
- Domain names not in existing configurations
- Credentials or sensitive configuration
- Business logic decisions not documented

#### **MUST ALWAYS VERIFY:**
- IRN format compliance with ICS standards
- Namespace consistency across all models
- URL structure alignment with existing services
- Configuration attribute correctness

### ERROR PREVENTION:

#### **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**
- Assuming AWS patterns when ICS is independent platform
- Using generic values without checking existing patterns
- Creating inconsistent namespaces across models
- Mixing service abbreviations (e.g., using both "islands" and "ims")
- Hardcoding configuration values without verification

#### **VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] All namespaces consistent with existing patterns
- [ ] All IRN formats match ICS standards and existing examples
- [ ] All service names align with existing definitions
- [ ] All configuration attributes verified or confirmed with user
- [ ] All assumptions documented and justified
